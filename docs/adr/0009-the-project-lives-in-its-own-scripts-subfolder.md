# The project lives in its own Scripts subfolder, under a fixed name

PinballY loads only `Scripts\main.js` (and its own `Scripts\System\`), so the project used to be copied straight into `Scripts\`, replacing the player's `main.js` and putting generic folders (`addons\`, `common\`, `lang\`, `assets\`, `profiles\`) next to whatever the player already had. The whole project now lives in `Scripts\ExpansionPack\`, which is the git repository, and installing it comes down to one line in the player's own `Scripts\main.js`: `import "./ExpansionPack/main.js";`. The code finds its folder from that fixed name, written once in the PinballY host, rather than detecting where it was loaded from. The player's data (`profiles\`, `.env.local`) stays inside that folder, next to the code.

## Considered Options

- **Detect the folder at run time, so the player can rename it.** Rejected: ChakraCore may not offer `import.meta.url`, and renaming the folder gives the player nothing.
- **Keep the player's data in a separate folder, so an update can replace the code folder wholesale.** Rejected: two folders to back up instead of one, and the installer must preserve `profiles\` and `.env.local` anyway.
- **A formal Add-on API (`registerAddon`, a context object) for third-party Add-ons.** Rejected: nobody else writes Add-ons, `main.js` is already the loader, the Add-ons are deliberately coupled (the Profile store first, a fixed order), and PinballY never unloads a script.

## Consequences

- An update must never overwrite `profiles\` or `.env.local` inside the folder: that is the Distribution's job.
- `System\` is no longer inside the repository, not even ignored: the cabinet's local checks on it live outside the project.
